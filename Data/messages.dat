There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows progressively larger."ãTo support its bulb, Ivysaur's legs grow sturdy. If it spends more time lying in the sunlight, the bud will soon bloom into a large flower."ëVenusaur's flower is said to take on vivid colors if it gets plenty of nutrition and sunlight. The flower's aroma soothes the emotions of people."óThe flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is happy, and blazes when it is enraged."ùWithout pity, its sharp claws destroy foes. If it encounters a strong enemy, it becomes agitated, and the flame on its tail flares with a bluish white color."òA Charizard flies about in search of strong opponents. It breathes intense flames that can melt any material. However, it will never torch a weaker foe."ûIts shell is not just for protection. Its rounded shape and the grooves on its surface minimize resistance in water, enabling Squirtle to swim at high speeds."ûIts large tail is covered with rich, thick fur that deepens in color with age. The scratches on its shell are evidence of this Pok√©mon's toughness in battle."ñThe waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate. Their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet."èIts voracious appetite compels it to devour leaves bigger than itself without hesitation. It releases a terribly strong odor from its antennae."êIts shell is as hard as an iron slab. A Metapod does not move very much because it is preparing its soft innards for evolution inside the shell."ñIt has a superior ability to search for delicious honey from flowers. It can seek, extract, and carry honey from flowers blooming over six miles away."£A Weedle has an extremely acute sense of smell. It distinguishes its favorite kinds of leaves from those it dislikes by sniffing with its big red proboscis (nose)."¢It remains virtually immobile while it clings to a tree. However, on the inside, it busily prepares for evolution. This is evident from how hot its shell becomes."áA Beedrill is extremely territorial. For safety reasons, no one should ever approach its nest. If angered, they will attack in a swarm."ñIt has an extremely sharp sense of direction. It can unerringly return home to its nest, however far it may be removed from its familiar surroundings."§This Pok√©mon flies around, patrolling its large territory. If its living space is violated, it shows no mercy in thoroughly punishing the foe with its sharp claws."òPidgeot has gorgeous, glossy feathers. Many trainers are so captivated by the beautiful feathers on its head that they choose Pidgeot as their Pok√©mon."ìA Rattata is cautious in the extreme. Even while it is asleep, it constantly moves its ears and listens for danger. It will make its nest anywhere."áA Raticate's sturdy fangs grow steadily. To keep them ground down, it gnaws on rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses."üIts loud cry can be heard over half a mile away. If its high, keening cry is heard echoing all around, it is a sign that they are warning each other of danger."ãIts long neck and elongated beak are ideal for catching prey in soil or water. It deftly moves this extended and skinny beak to pluck prey."§An Ekans curls itself up in a spiral while it rests. This position allows it to quickly respond to an enemy from any direction with a threat from its upraised head."üThis Pok√©mon has a terrifically strong constricting power. It can even flatten steel oil drums. Once it wraps its body around its foe, escaping is impossible."ñIt stores electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks. When it releases pent-up energy in a burst, the electric power is equal to a lightning bolt."êIf it stores too much electricity, its behavior turns aggressive. To avoid this, it occasionally discharges excess energy and calms itself down."íWhen it curls up in a ball, it can make any attack bounce off harmlessly. Its hide has turned tough and solid as a result of living in the desert."ïIt curls up in a ball to protect itself from enemy attacks. It also curls up to prevent heatstroke during the daytime when temperatures rise sharply."úIts highly toxic barbs are thought to have developed as protection for this small-bodied Pok√©mon. When enraged, it releases a horrible toxin from its horn."éWhen it is with its friends or family, its barbs are tucked away to prevent injury. It appears to become nervous if separated from the others."îIt is adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles using its tough, scaly body. This Pok√©mon is at its strongest when it is defending its young."ìThe male Nidoran has developed muscles that freely move its ears in any direction. Even the slightest sound does not escape this Pok√©mon's notice."üIts horn is harder than a diamond. If it senses a hostile presence, all the barbs on its back bristle up at once, and it challenges the foe with all its might."ûA Nidoking's thick tail packs enormously destructive power capable of toppling a metal transmission tower. Once it goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it."¢On every night of a full moon, they come out to play. When dawn arrives, the tired Clefairy go to sleep nestled up against each other in deep and quiet mountains."öA Clefable uses its wings to skip lightly as if it were flying. Its bouncy step lets it even walk on water. On quiet, moonlit nights, it strolls on lakes."ÜIt can freely control fire, making fiery orbs fly like will-o'-the-wisps. Just before evolution, its six tails grow hot as if on fire."àIt has long been said that each of the nine tails embody an enchanted power. A long-lived Ninetales will have fur that shines like gold."îNothing can avoid falling asleep hearing a Jigglypuff's song. The sound waves of its singing voice match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep."ìIts fur is the ultimate in luxuriousness. Sleeping alongside a Wigglytuff is simply divine. Its body expands seemingly without end when it inhales."èWhile living in pitch-black caverns, their eyes gradually grew shut and deprived them of vision. They use ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles."úIts fangs easily puncture even thick animal hide. It loves to feast on the blood of people and Pok√©mon. It flits about in darkness and strikes from behind."óIt grows by absorbing moonlight. During the daytime, it buries itself in the ground, leaving only its leaves exposed to avoid detection by its enemies."üA horribly noxious honey drools from its mouth. One whiff of the honey can result in memory loss. Some fans are said to enjoy this overwhelming stink, however."ûIn seasons when it produces more pollen, the air around a Vileplume turns yellow with the powder as it walks. The pollen is highly toxic and causes paralysis."ôA Paras has parasitic tochukaso mushrooms growing on its back. They grow by drawing nutrients from the host. They are valued as a medicine for long life."òParasect are known to infest the roots of large trees en masse and drain nutrients. When an infested tree dies, they move onto another tree all at once."óIts coat of thin, stiff hair that covers its entire body is said to have evolved for protection. Its large eyes never fail to spot even miniscule prey."üVenomoth are nocturnal--they only are active at night. Their favorite prey are insects that gather around streetlights, attracted by the light in the darkness."åDiglett are raised in most farms. The reason is simple--wherever they burrow, the soil is left perfectly tilled for growing delicious crops."éBecause the triplets originally split from one body, they think exactly alike. They work cooperatively to burrow endlessly through the ground."îMeowth withdraw their sharp claws into their paws to silently sneak about. For some reason, this Pok√©mon loves shiny coins that glitter with light."ÖA Persian's six bold whiskers sense air movements to determine what is in its vicinity. It becomes docile if grabbed by the whiskers."öWhen its headache intensifies, it starts using strange powers. However, it has no recollection of its powers, so it always looks befuddled and bewildered."ëA Golduck is an adept swimmer. It sometimes joins competitive swimmers in training. It uses psychic powers when its forehead shimmers with light."óWhen it starts shaking and its nasal breathing turns rough, it's a sure sign of anger. However, since this happens instantly, there is no time to flee."ëWhen it becomes furious, its blood circulation becomes more robust, and its muscles are made stronger. But it also becomes much less intelligent."ôIts superb sense of smell ensures that this Pok√©mon won't forget any scent, no matter what. It uses its sense of smell to detect the emotions of others."ôThis fleet-footed Pok√©mon is said to run over 6,200 miles in a single day and night. The fire that blazes wildly within its body is its source of power."†It is possible to see this Pok√©mon's spiral innards right through its thin skin. However, the skin is also very flexible. Even sharp fangs bounce right off it."¶Its body surface is always wet and slick with an oily fluid. Because of this greasy covering, it can easily slip and slide out of the clutches of any enemy in battle."õIts highly developed muscles never grow fatigued, however much it exercises. This Pok√©mon can swim back and forth across the Pacific Ocean without effort."~A Pok√©mon that sleeps 18 hours a day. Observation revealed that it uses Teleport to change its location once every hour."ãIt is rumored that a boy with psychic abilities suddenly transformed into Kadabra while he was assisting research into extrasensory powers."âWhile it has strong psychic abilities and high intelligence, an Alakazam's muscles are very weak. It uses psychic power to move its body."óIt continually undertakes strenuous training to master all forms of martial arts. Its strength lets it easily hoist a sumo wrestler onto its shoulders."áA belt is worn by a Machoke to keep its overwhelming power under control. Because it is so dangerous, no one has ever removed the belt."éIt is impossible to defend against punches and chops doled out by its four arms. Its fighting spirit flares up when it faces a tough opponent."°A Bellsprout's thin and flexible body lets it bend and sway to avoid any attack, however strong it may be. From its mouth, it leaks a fluid that melts even iron."üAt night, a Weepinbell hangs on to a tree branch with its hooked rear and sleeps. If it moves around in its sleep, it may wake up to find itself on the ground."°The long vine extending from its head is waved about as if it were a living thing to attract prey. When an unsuspecting victim approaches, it is swallowed whole."íIts body is almost entirely composed of water. It ensnares its foe with its two long tentacles, then stabs with the poison stingers at their tips."íIt lives in complex rock formations on the ocean floor and traps prey using its 80 tentacles. Its red orbs glow when it grows excited or agitated."óIt climbs mountain paths using only the power of its arms. Because they look just like boulders lining paths, hikers may step on them without noticing."úThey descend from mountains by tumbling down steep slopes. They are so brutal, they smash aside obstructing trees and huge boulders with thunderous tackles."öIt is said to live in volcanic craters on mountain peaks. Once a year, it sheds its hide and grows larger. The shed hide crumbles and returns to the soil."íA Ponyta is very weak at birth. It can barely stand up. Its legs become stronger as it stumbles and falls while trying to keep up with its parent."ùIt usually canters casually in the fields and plains. But once a Rapidash turns serious, its fiery manes flare and blaze as it gallops its way up to 150 mph."¢It catches prey by dipping its tail in water at the side of a river. But it often forgets what it is doing and spends whole days just loafing at the water's edge."†Its tail has a Shellder firmly attached with a bite. As a result, the tail can't be used for fishing anymore. This forces it to reluctantly swim and catch prey."ÜThe units at its sides are extremely powerful magnets. They generate enough magnetism to draw in iron objects from over 300 feet away."öIt is actually three Magnemite linked by magnetism. It generates powerful radio waves that raise temperatures by 3.6 degrees F within a 3,300-foot radius."†It is always seen with a stick from a plant. Apparently, there are good sticks and bad sticks. This Pok√©mon occasionally fights with others over choice sticks."îEven while eating or sleeping, one of the heads remains always vigilant for any sign of danger. When threatened, it flees at over 60 miles per hour."ÅA peculiar Pok√©mon species with three heads. It vigorously races across grassy plains even in arid seasons with little rainfall."úSeel hunt for prey in frigid, ice-covered seas. When it needs to breathe, it punches a hole through the ice with the sharply protruding section of its head."óIt loves to snooze on bitterly cold ice. The sight of this Pok√©mon sleeping on a glacier was mistakenly thought to be a mermaid by a mariner long ago."ÉBorn from polluted sludge in the sea, Grimer's favorite food is anything filthy. They feed on wastewater pumped out from factories."èIt prefers warm and humid habitats.
